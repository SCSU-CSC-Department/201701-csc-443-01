## Asynchronous JavaScript (AJAX) - GET Requests

### Instructions

Use JavaScript to fetch JSON data from [this URL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SCSU-CSC-Department/201701-csc-443-01/master/course.json) and log the results to the console.

Recognize you can't access the data from within the global scope. Practice accessing the data by passing it into the global scope or by inserting a `debugger` statement within the local scope of the function making the request.
